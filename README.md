# Object-Detection----Computer-Vision
As a part of DeepLearning Specialisation from DeepLearning.ai this code is an algorithm for detecting cats in a dataset.
I was able to make an object detector using Logistic Regression which identified cats in a data set. 
It involved Forward and Backward Propagation along a single layer Neural Network and classifying the output using Binary Classification through sigmoid function. 
The output--1 for a cat, 0 for a not cat. With percentage of algorithm's accuracy and speed
The author Andrew Ng first worked on this project back in 2011-12 with Google Brain and taught the algorithm for same in this specialisation.
